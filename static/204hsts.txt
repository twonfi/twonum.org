<https://twonum.org/_hsts> is used to ensure the HTTP Strict
Transport Security (HSTS) policy is loaded for twonum.org and
all subdomains.

Due to the proxy system of www.twonum.org's host (Nest), an
HTTP to HTTPS redirect is not possible.  This URL is used for a
reasonably lightweight automatic HTTPS redirection method.
Although twonum.org is included in the HSTS preload list, older
user agents may not use an updated version of it.

Requests to this URL returns 204 (No Content) and is cached for
one year (the max-age of the HSTS policy).  If the HSTS preload
list for your browser includes twonum.org, you are welcome to
block it in your browser.
