# twonum.org: My long-overdue personal website
I've been wanting to code my personal website for a while and never did.
Until the Summer of Making rolled around, so I started coding my website.

Unlike my original static site idea, I decided to use Django with Python for this website.

## Contributions
Code contributions are absolutely welcome! But not content contributions (as they are hosted on a Django database).

## License
See `COPYING`.
The reason for AGPLv3 is that twonum.org is my personal website, which is much more different than, say,
[ClubFeed](//github.com/twonfi/clubfeed), a general-purpose application.
